Problem statement about my Project:

“Hotel menu driven system with Tkinter”

Nowadays most of the things are running on online platforms, it is not due to COVID19 but now people more prefer online things as it is more convenient and people don’t get time to spend on specific things. Even according to survey, nearly 81% of consumers order food via delivery apps as they do it for convenience, 14% said it was due to discount provided by these apps and rest said we get better options.

As we can also see, how “Zomato” and “Swiggy” seize the entire market very well in short time. 

So, I just thought, why not I should start with my own designed hotel menu which truly believe in servicing delicious food. 

My objective of this project was to make attractive hotel menu which consist of different food items at reasonable rate. 

I have made this menu with the help of tkinter which is giving exact app kind of look.
